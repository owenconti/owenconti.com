I believe in the theory that people are generally good. I also believe that people can do better. I'm using this page to serve as a living list of areas where I think people can do better. These are gripes I have with the general public and are not meant to be taken too seriously, don't read into it too much.

## People who manage public events

The flow of humans entering and exiting your venue is critical to the overall experience of the event. I recently attended a Monster Jam event with my family. We arrived to the premises 35 minutes before show time. It took over an hour to get to our parking spot, walk to the doors, and then get to our seats. All because there was no organization or instruction given to the parking attendants. Additionally, other attendees were confused due to the lack of communication and lack of signage which led to them stopping their cars on the main road while trying to look down rows for a parking spot.

All of this could have been avoided with three things:

- signage/road blocks to direct traffic
- parking attendants directing traffic with authority, not some teenagers who are just there to make a few bucks

Secondly, when leaving the venue, rather than opening up the giant chain link gates to let people out, they routed everyone back through the main doors. This caused a bottleneck of people trying to leave the venue. It seems like common sense to me that when your 15,000 people event is over, you should open up all exits to let people leave.

## People shopping in public

We've all been there: Costco on a Sunday. A bad decision, no doubt, but sometimes a necessary one. My family and I went today. Within the first 5 minutes I had to say "excuse me, sorry" three different times as I had to squeeze my cart passed someone parked in the middle of the aisle.

The easiest thing people can do to improve the experience of others is to park your shopping cart against the side of the aisle when you stop to look at an item.
