I recently bought a 2004 Jeep TJ. Being that the vehicle is now 20 years old, it's no surprise that some of the bolts are starting to rust. I was removing the roof rack that came on the Jeep when I started to strip a couple of the allen bolts.

The torx bit is slightly larger than the allen bolt, so it can grip onto the bolt and turn it. I threw a torx bit into my drill and was able to remove the stripped allen bolts with ease.
