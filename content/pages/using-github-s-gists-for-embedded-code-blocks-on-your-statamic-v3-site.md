Check how easy it is to have proper syntax highlighting added to your code blocks:

![](/assets/statamic-gists-example.gif)Turns into this when you save:

```js
const foo = {'bar': 123};
```

**How easy was that?!?**

Couldn't be any easier to get awesome syntax highlighting directly into your website!

### How does it work?

It works via the **Oh See Gists** Statamic v3 add-on: [https://statamic.com/marketplace/addons/oh-see-gists](https://statamic.com/marketplace/addons/oh-see-gists)

The add-on uses your GitHub account to sync your entry's content to Gists whenever you save data.

### Find it on the Statamic marketplace

If you have a site running Statamic v3 and you're looking to embed code blocks with proper syntax highlighting, look no further!

Another awesome benefit is you don't have to worry about installing CSS/JS for syntax highlighting into your site. GitHub's Gist `iframe` will include all of that for you.
