## Hello from Laracon!

If you're reading this, then we've probably talked at [Laracon](https://laracon.us) in Dallas! Here's a bit more about me and what I do:

- My name is Owen Conti, I live up in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
- I have an amazing [wife](https://www.instagram.com/jess.the.nurse/) and two kids, ages 5 and 3. We just got back from an 11 day road trip in our motorhome, and it was a blast!
- I am a co-founder of [Springloaded](https://springloaded.co), a software development studio where we focus on custom applications for our clients

## Tech stack

- My preferred tech stack is Laravel, Inertia (ask me about Hybridly!), React or Vue.js (prefer React), Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL
- Even though I prefer the Inertia stack, I still see value and use Livewire/Blade for some of my projects
