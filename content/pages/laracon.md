## Hello from Laracon!

If you are reading this, then we have likely met at Laracon in Dallas! Here is some more information about me and what I do:

- My name is Owen Conti, and I live in Canada.
- I have an amazing wife and two kids, ages 5 and 3. We recently returned from an 11-day road trip in our motorhome, and it was fantastic!
- I am a co-founder of Springloaded, a software development studio where we specialize in custom applications for our clients.

## Tech stack:

- My preferred tech stack includes Laravel, Inertia (feel free to ask me about Hybridly!), React or Vue.js (I prefer React), Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL.
- Although I prefer the Inertia stack, I still see value in and use Livewire/Blade for some of my projects.
