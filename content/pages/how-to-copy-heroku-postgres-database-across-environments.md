If you find yourself needing to copy a database across environments (say production to staging) you can use this one line command from Heroku:

```
heroku pg:backups:restore {original_env}::{backup_id} {DATABASE_URL} --app {new_env}
```

Where:

- `original_env` is the name of the environment you are pulling the backup from
- `backup_id` is the ID of the backup, found on the Durability tab of the Heroku Postgres database page
- `DATABASE_URL` is the env var that Heroku generated for the new database
- `new_env` is the new application ID that has the `DATABASE_URL` attached to it
